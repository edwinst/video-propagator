# Contour integral for free field propagator

This repository contains source code for the video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3nMiuMPgT8

The video is about the calculation of the two-point function in one of the
simplest cases in quantum field theory: The propagator of a free, real, massive
scalar field at purely spatial separations. The video shows the behavior of the
integrand and the integral in this calculation and the deformation of the
contour applied to define this integral mathematically.

The video is the result of a small project I did in order to become familiar
with this kind of oscillatory integrals. I share it in the hope that it might
be interesting for someone else.
